Listens for messages on the queue.
This process runs continuously. 

Approach
---------
Simple - one producer / one consumer.


Since this process runs continuously, 
if we want to emit more messages, 
we'll need to open a new terminal window.


Terminal Reminders
------------------

- Use Control c to close a terminal and end a process.

- Use the up arrow to get the last command executed.
